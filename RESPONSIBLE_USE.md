# Responsible Use Guidelines

This repository contains sensitive public interest documents regarding the Epstein Estate, released by the U.S. House Oversight Committee. Access to this data comes with significant ethical responsibilities. By accessing or using this dataset, you agree to adhere to the following guidelines.

## 1. Prohibited Use Cases
To prevent harm and misuse, the following activities are strictly prohibited:

*   **No Fine-Tuning:** Do not use this dataset to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) or other generative AI models. The risk of a model hallucinating false accusations or generating non-consensual sexual content based on this corpus is too high.
*   **No Doxing:** Do not use this data to identify, harass, or expose private contact information of victims or non-public figures.
*   **No Circumvention:** Do not use technical means to recover text under redaction bars/blocks.

## 2. Research Integrity
*   **Context Matters:** These documents contain a mixture of verified legal filings, unverified witness statements, and raw notes. Do not present unverified allegations as established fact.
*   **Attribution:** Any findings derived from this dataset must cite the specific document ID and the original U.S. House Oversight Committee release.
*   **Automated Analysis:** If using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) or clustering algorithms, you must manually verify the source text before publishing results. AI hallucinations regarding this specific subject matter can cause real-world legal and reputational harm.

## 3. Victim Privacy
*   Treat all individuals mentioned—particularly potential victims—with dignity.
*   Adhere to standard journalistic ethics regarding the privacy of victims of sexual abuse.
